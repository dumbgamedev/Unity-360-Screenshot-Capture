# Unity-360-Screenshot-Capture
Playmaker actions for the opensource Unity 360 screen capture package

Works in conjunction with the "Unity 360° Screenshot Capture" open source package for unity. Found here: https://github.com/yasirkula/Unity360ScreenshotCapture

1. Simply import the Unity 360° Screenshot Capture package to unity,
2. Download this repo and paste the file ScreenShot360.cs into your unity project. Playmaker will automatically find the new playmaker action called "Screen Shot 360" under the "Custom" section.
